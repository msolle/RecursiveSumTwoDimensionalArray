RecursiveSumTwoDimensionalArray
=======================
Problem taken from Data Structures & Algorithms In Java 5th Edition
>R-3.4 "Describe a way to use recursion to add all the elements in a *n x n* (two-dimensional) array of integers."  
The sum happens in two steps: 
1. Define a method to recursively add elements in a one dimensional array
2. Define a second method to recursively call the first method.
